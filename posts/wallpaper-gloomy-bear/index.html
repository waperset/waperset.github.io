In the end, the narrator is successful in driving the woman mad. She becomes so obsessed with the wallpaper that she tears it off the walls in an attempt to free the woman she believes is trapped inside. The final line of the story, “I’ve got out at last,” can be interpreted as either the narrator’s triumph over her own madness or her descent into it.
The color purple has been associated with royalty and wealth for centuries. It’s no wonder, then, that the protagonist of “The Yellow Wallpaper” would be drawn to the purple wallpaper in her room. But what begins as an aesthetic preference quickly turns into an obsession. The wallpaper comes to represent everything that is wrong with her life: her stifling marriage, her lack of autonomy, her mental illness.</p><h2 id=gloomy-bear-wallpapers---wallpaper-cave-1>Gloomy Bear Wallpapers - Wallpaper Cave<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gloomy-bear-wallpapers---wallpaper-cave-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp9457398.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.oALUjVp2jCxKz8ttB4TXfQHaKR&pid=15.1"' alt="Gloomy Bear Wallpapers - Wallpaper Cave"><p><em>Source: wallpapercave.com</em></p><blockquote><p>gloomy tenshi unkai claws ice zerochan.</p></blockquote><ol><li>What is basketball wallpaper?
