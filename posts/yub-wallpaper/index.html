War wallpaper is a type of wallpaper that features military scenes or symbols. It is often used to decorate homes of veterans, active duty military personnel, or patriotic citizens. War wallpaper has a long history, dating back to the 18th century. Early war wallpapers were hand-painted and featured battles from the Seven Years&rsquo; War or the American Revolution. Today, war wallpaper is mass-produced and can be found in many home decor stores. It is still popular among veterans and those who support the military.</p><h2 id=warning-just-a-picture-not-a-desktop-background-submission-meme-yub--yub>(warning Just A Picture Not A Desktop Background Submission) MEME YUB : YuB<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#warning-just-a-picture-not-a-desktop-background-submission-meme-yub--yub>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.redd.it/fyogino04mq11.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jkfGUTi3N5sZUEgW9lwrrwHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="(warning just a picture not a desktop background submission) MEME YUB : YuB"><p><em>Source: reddit.com</em></p><blockquote><p>yub warning.</p></blockquote><p>Wallpaper trends
