Living wallpapers are a new trend in home decorating, and they&rsquo;re gaining popularity because of the many benefits they offer. A living wallpaper is basically a wallpaper that can move and change its appearance according to your mood or surroundings. This can be especially useful if you want to create a unique and personalized interior design without spending a fortune on custom wallpaper designs.
Some other benefits of using living wallpapers include the fact that they&rsquo;re energy-efficient, since you won&rsquo;t need to use as much power to keep them moving; they also look great in any room, regardless of its size; and finally, they&rsquo;re easy to maintain - all you need is some water and a little soap to keep them looking fresh.</p><h2 id=tricky-the-clown---desciclopÃ©dia>Tricky The Clown - DesciclopÃ©dia<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tricky-the-clown---desciclopÃ©dia>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://images.uncyc.org/pt/thumb/2/2d/Clown_Kills_You.PNG/250px-Clown_Kills_You.PNG onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.BUTwPM7mcPEKq6paORU4mwAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Tricky the Clown - DesciclopÃ©dia"><p><em>Source: desciclopedia.org</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>How to change your desktop wallpaper
