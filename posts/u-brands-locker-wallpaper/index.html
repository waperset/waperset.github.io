Be sure to cover the entire back of the design so that it will stick to the wall properly.</p><p>Press the wallpaper design onto the wall and smooth it out with your hands. Make sure there are no air bubbles or wrinkles in the wallpaper.</p><h2 id=faq--the-lockers>FAQ | The Lockers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#faq--the-lockers>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.thelockers.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lockers_logo_colors.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.pq6s2DvnhSX_t0WrYAvn4gAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="FAQ | The Lockers"><p><em>Source: thelockers.gr</em></p><blockquote><p>lockers.</p></blockquote><p>Section 2: how to set up game wallpaper
