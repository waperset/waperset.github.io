There are many different types of monitors and each has its own specific requirements for desktop backgrounds. This means that not all wallpaper designs will look great on all monitors.
To help determine which desktop backgrounds look best on your monitor, follow these tips:
-First, make sure to correctly size the wallpaper to the size of your monitor. If it&rsquo;s too large or too small, it may not look well on your monitor.
-Secondly, choose a wallpaper design that has good contrast and brightness. Brightness ensures that the image is visible in high-light and low-light conditions and contrast helps improve the visibility of small details in the image.
-Thirdly, be sure to adjust any distortion or jagged edges if necessary. These issues can cause the image to look blurry or distorted when viewed on a monitor.</p><h2 id=night-view-tokyo-tower-japan-1800x2880--wallpapers13com>Night View Tokyo Tower Japan 1800x2880 : Wallpapers13.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#night-view-tokyo-tower-japan-1800x2880--wallpapers13com>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.wallpapers13.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Night-View-Tokyo-Tower-Japan-1800x2880-1440x900.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.7quMnWszCHEW12s8V8EKHwHaEo&pid=15.1"' alt="Night View Tokyo Tower Japan 1800x2880 : Wallpapers13.com"><p><em>Source: wallpapers13.com</em></p><blockquote><p>tokyo night japan tower hour resolution cityscape landscape paris wallpapers13 1920 wallpapers macbook air xbox imgur superb 1800 reyes rafael.</p></blockquote><p>The best live wallpaper apps
