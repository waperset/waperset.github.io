The story is a feminist ballad, revealing how women were confined by their gender roles at the turn of the century. Through the narrator&rsquo;s eyes, we see how a woman was not only expected to perform domestic duties, but also please her husband sexually and emotionally. If she could not do so, she was considered mad.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://waperset.github.io/tags/wallpaper-photos-images/>wallpaper photos images</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://waperset.github.io/posts/z-flip-3-gif-wallpaper/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Z Flip 3 Gif Wallpaper : Heart Mobile Phone Hearts Wallpapers Valentine</span></a>
