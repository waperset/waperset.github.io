When it comes to decorating your home, one of the most popular choices is a gray or light blue wallpaper. This color has been in style for years, and it’s easy to see why. Gray wallpapers are versatile and go with just about any color scheme. They can also add a touch of sophistication to a room. But how did gray wallpaper become so popular in the first place?

They’re also great for people who live in small apartments or homes where there isn’t much space to display colorful wallpaper. Plus, gray wallpapers are relatively affordable, which is another reason they’ve become so popular over the past few years.</p><h2 id=walter---dog---june-14-2017>Walter - Dog - June 14, 2017<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#walter---dog---june-14-2017>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://dogoftheday.com/archive/2017/June/14j.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.P6lLMKc8FgvdxX-9pGPU8QHaIF&pid=15.1"' alt="Walter - Dog - June 14, 2017"><p><em>Source: dogoftheday.com</em></p><blockquote><p>june walter dog talk pet.</p></blockquote><p>Looking for a way to add a touch of nostalgia to your desktop?
