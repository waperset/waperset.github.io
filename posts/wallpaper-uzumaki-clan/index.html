Kawaii culture is characterized by its typically round or heart-shaped facial features, simple and pastel colors, and characteristic anime-inspired graphics. These characteristics arose from a desire among Japanese youth to look cute and stylish. The term “kawaii” was first used in the 1970s to describe Japanese comic books and animation that were aimed at children. At this time, many children in Japan were wearing colorful clothing inspired by these works, which gave rise to the Japanese expression “kawaii ga suki,” meaning “I like it cute.” Kawaii became popularized outside of Japan during the 1990s when people began using it as a way to describe things that are visually pleasing or charming.\n","wordCount":"2006","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-08-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-08-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rod Hettinger DVM"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://waperset.github.io/posts/wallpaper-uzumaki-clan/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"waperset","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://waperset.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://waperset.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://waperset.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://waperset.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://waperset.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://waperset.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://waperset.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Wallpaper Uzumaki Clan : Uzumaki Clan Wallpapers</h1><div class=post-description>Uzumaki clan wallpapers</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-08-03 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 3, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2006 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Rod Hettinger DVM</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#uzumaki-naruto1981731>Uzumaki Naruto/#1981731</a></li><li><a href=#uzumaki-clan-wallpapers---wallpaper-cave>Uzumaki Clan Wallpapers -

Kawaii culture originated in Japan, specifically in the cities of Tokyo and Osaka. Kawaii culture is characterized by its typically round or heart-shaped facial features, simple and pastel colors, and characteristic anime-inspired graphics. These characteristics arose from a desire among Japanese youth to look cute and stylish.
The term &ldquo;kawaii&rdquo; was first used in the 1970s to describe Japanese comic books and animation that were aimed at children. At this time, many children in Japan were wearing colorful clothing inspired by these works, which gave rise to the Japanese expression &ldquo;kawaii ga suki,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;I like it cute.&rdquo; Kawaii became popularized outside of Japan during the 1990s when people began using it as a way to describe things that are visually pleasing or charming.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://waperset.github.io/tags/wallpaper-photos-images/>wallpaper photos images</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://waperset.github.io/posts/wallpaper-rebecca-ferguson/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Wallpaper Rebecca Ferguson : Cotinga Spangled</span></a>
