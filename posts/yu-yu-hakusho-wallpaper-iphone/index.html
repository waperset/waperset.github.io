In the end, the narrator is successful in driving the woman mad. She becomes so obsessed with the wallpaper that she tears it off the walls in an attempt to free the woman she believes is trapped inside. The final line of the story, “I’ve got out at last,” can be interpreted as either the narrator’s triumph over her own madness or her descent into it.
The color purple has been associated with royalty and wealth for centuries. It’s no wonder, then, that the protagonist of “The Yellow Wallpaper” would be drawn to the purple wallpaper in her room. But what begins as an aesthetic preference quickly turns into an obsession. The wallpaper comes to represent everything that is wrong with her life: her stifling marriage, her lack of autonomy, her mental illness.</p><h2 id=yu-yu-hakusho-wallpapers---wallpaper-cave--anime-anime-nerd-anime-images>Yu Yu Hakusho Wallpapers - Wallpaper Cave | Anime, Anime Nerd, Anime Images<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#yu-yu-hakusho-wallpapers---wallpaper-cave--anime-anime-nerd-anime-images>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3c/6b/69/3c6b69af946ec92ec30351c43ed45393.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Tcwo8XgMGBuutC9vfqyx9wHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Yu Yu Hakusho Wallpapers - Wallpaper Cave | Anime, Anime nerd, Anime images"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>hakusho.</p></blockquote><p>The drawbacks of screen wallpaper
In the past decade, screen wallpaper has become a popular way to personalize one&rsquo;s computer desktop. While there are many positive aspects to using screen wallpaper, there are also several drawbacks.
One of the main drawbacks of screen wallpaper is that it can be distracting. When trying to focus on work or schoolwork, having a busy or brightly-colored background can make it difficult to concentrate. In addition, if the image is not high quality, it can appear blurry or pixelated on the screen. This can also be distracting and make it difficult to read text on the desktop.</p><p>Another downside to screen wallpaper is that it can take up a lot of computer memory. If an image is large or high resolution, it can consume a significant amount of RAM and slow down the overall performance of the computer.</p><h2 id=yu-yu-hakusho-wallpapers-high-quality--download-free>Yu Yu Hakusho Wallpapers High Quality | Download Free<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#yu-yu-hakusho-wallpapers-high-quality--download-free>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://yesofcorsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/4172_yu_yu_hakusho.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.A8jdbpWKRqp28x-aF0rQEgHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="Yu Yu Hakusho Wallpapers High Quality | Download Free"><p><em>Source: yesofcorsa.com</em></p><blockquote><p>yu hakusho wallpapers.</p></blockquote><p>How to Hang: Wallpaper can be hung in a number of ways, including traditional paste and more modern peel-and-stick methods.
