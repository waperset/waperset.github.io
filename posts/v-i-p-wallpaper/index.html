Wallpaper has been around for centuries, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the late 20th century that minimalist wallpaper became popular.

In the world of wallpaper, this means designs that are free of busy patterns and unnecessary embellishments.
Minimalist wallpaper first gained popularity in the 1970s as part of the wider minimalism movement in the arts. This new style was a reaction against the excesses of previous decades, and minimalism&rsquo;s emphasis on simplicity and functionality resonated with many people.
