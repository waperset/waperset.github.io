Pig wallpaper, also known as mud plaster or render, is a type of wall covering made from a mixture of plaster and pigments. The different types of brushes used to apply pig wallpaper are the roller brush, the trowel, and the scraper.
The roller brush is used to apply the mixture onto the wall. It has a thin head that makes it easy to cover a large area with smooth, even strokes. The trowel is similar to the roller brush but has a wider head that helps you get into tight spaces and make deeper lines.
