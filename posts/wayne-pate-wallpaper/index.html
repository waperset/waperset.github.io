Beach wallpapers are a great way to bring the outdoors in and add a touch of summer to your home décor. Here are a few tips on how to hang beach wallpaper:</p><ol><li><p>Choose a wall that gets plenty of light for your beach wallpaper. This will help to brighten up the room and create a cheerful atmosphere.</p></li><li><p>Make sure the surface you’re going to be wallpapering is clean, dry and smooth. Any bumps or unevenness will show through the wallpaper.</p></li><li><p>When measuring for your beach wallpaper, add an extra inch or two around all sides so you have some wiggle room when hanging it.</p></li><li><p>Apply paste or adhesive to the back of the wallpaper according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Be generous with the amount you use so the paper will stick well to the wall.</p></li></ol><h2 id=wayne-pate-wallpaper-and-textiles-from-studio-four-nyc-1>Wayne Pate Wallpaper And Textiles From Studio Four NYC<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#wayne-pate-wallpaper-and-textiles-from-studio-four-nyc-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://media.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wayne-pate-plates-1-733x733.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.pcOaFIpFeKiOMYqSMoSR8AHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="Wayne Pate wallpaper and textiles from Studio Four NYC"><p><em>Source: remodelista.com</em></p><blockquote><p>remodelista.</p></blockquote><p>what is minimalism?
What is minimalism?
In its simplest form, minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of everything that distracts us from them. This can be applied to many areas of life, including but not limited to our physical possessions, the food we eat, the way we spend our time, and even the thoughts we think.</p><p>When it comes to our physical possessions, minimalists believe that less is more. We only keep things that serve a purpose or bring us joy, and get rid of anything that doesn’t fall into those categories. This decluttering process can be liberating and empowering, as it allows us to focus on what’s truly important to us.</p><p>Minimalism also extends to the food we eat.</p><h2 id=wayne-pate--wallpaper--decor-inside-home-home-decor>Wayne Pate ?
