When it comes to wallpaper, there are two options: hire a professional or do it yourself. If you decide to take on the project yourself, there are a few things you need to know. First, choose the right type of wallpaper. There are three main types of wallpaper: vinyl-coated, paper-backed and fabric-backed. Vinyl-coated wallpaper is the most durable and easiest to clean; paper-backed wallpaper is the least durable but easiest to install; and fabric-backed wallpaper is somewhere in between. Second, make sure you have all the tools you need before you start. You will need a measuring tape, level, pencil, straight edge, utility knife and paste brush. Third, calculate how much wallpaper you will need before you start buying. To do this, measure the width and height of each wall and add up all the numbers.</p><h2 id=i-don039t-give-a-yiff-by-kingneroche-on-deviantart>I Don't Give A Yiff.
