In &ldquo;The Yellow Wallpaper,&rdquo; Charlotte Perkins Gilman uses first-person narration to tell the story of a woman descending into madness. The narrator is confined to a room with yellow wallpaper and she becomes obsessed with it. She starts to believe that there is a woman trapped behind the wallpaper and she must free her. The story is a commentary on the treatment of women in the 19th century, when they were seen as fragile and in need of constant care. The story ends with the narrator tearing down the wallpaper and revealing the woman behind it, who turns out to be herself.</p><h2 id=dolphin-wallpaper--1920x1200--35665--wallpaperup>Dolphin Wallpaper | 1920x1200 | 35665 | WallpaperUP<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dolphin-wallpaper--1920x1200--35665--wallpaperup>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://res.cloudinary.com/twenty20/image/private/t_thumb-detect/v1511865696/photosp/fbee55d7-8635-48a8-b830-91938bbf228d.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.6nMzWN6Lx05WSA8xLnhZoQAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Dolphin wallpaper | 1920x1200 | 35665 | WallpaperUP"><p><em>Source: wallpaperup.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Conclusion: why 1920x1080 is the best resolution for wallpapers
