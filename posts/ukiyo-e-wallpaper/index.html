While desktop wallpaper can add personality and pizzazz to your computer, it can also be a source of frustration. If you choose a busy pattern or a dark color, it can be difficult to read text on your screen. And if you have a lot of icons on your desktop, the wallpaper can make it hard to find what you&rsquo;re looking for.
Another downside of using desktop wallpaper is that it can slow down your computer. If your computer is already running slowly, adding a complex wallpaper will only make things worse. And if you have a lot of programs open at once, the wallpaper can make it harder for your computer to keep up.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to personalize your computer without causing any headaches, stick to simpler wallpapers or even just a solid color.
