4K wallpaper is a resolution that is four times higher than full HD. This means that there are more pixels per inch, which results in a sharper image. 4K wallpaper also has a wider color gamut, meaning that it can display more colors than traditional wallpaper. Finally, 4K wallpaper is designed to be printed on special paper that is thicker and more durable than traditional wallpaper.
