A wallpaper is a digital image that serves as a background on a device such as a phone. A personal photo can make for a great wallpaper, and there are a few ways to go about setting it up.
To use a personal photo as a wallpaper, the image will need to be high resolution so that it doesn&rsquo;t appear pixelated when enlarged. Once you have a good quality image, open it in an editing program like Photoshop or GIMP and crop it down to the desired size.</p><p>If you want your wallpaper to be more than just a single photo, you can create a collage of several images. To do this, start by finding photos that compliment each other in terms of color and theme.
