The Yellow Wallpaper is a short story written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. The story is about a woman who is suffering from post-partum depression and is prescribed &ldquo;the rest cure&rdquo; by her husband. The woman becomes obsessed with the wallpaper in her room and eventually goes insane.
Gilman wrote The Yellow Wallpaper as a response to the Victorian era&rsquo;s treatment of women&rsquo;s mental health. She was prescribed the rest cure when she was suffering from post-partum depression and it made her condition worse. Gilman wanted to raise awareness about the dangers of this treatment and show that it was not effective.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://waperset.github.io/tags/wallpaper-photos-images/>wallpaper photos images</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://waperset.github.io/posts/wallpaper-cleveland-indians/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Wallpaper Cleveland Indians : Cleveland Indians Wallpapers</span></a>
