When it comes to wallpaper, there are endless possibilities. But if you&rsquo;re looking for something calming and serene, pastel wallpaper is the way to go. Here are a few things to consider when choosing the right pastel wallpaper for your space:</p><ol><li><p>Colour: Not all pastels are created equal. If you want a warm and inviting space, go for softer shades like peach or lavender. For a more modern look, try mint green or light blue.</p></li><li><p>Pattern: If you&rsquo;re going for a solid colour, make sure the pattern is simple and understated. But if you want something with a little more personality, go for a wallpaper with a subtle print or geometric design.</p></li><li><p>Texture: Want your wallpaper to really stand out? Go for one with an interesting texture, like flocked velvet or grasscloth.</p></li></ol><h2 id=wonderful-tropical-waterfall-jungle-green-tropical-vegetation-palm>Wonderful Tropical Waterfall Jungle Green Tropical Vegetation Palm<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#wonderful-tropical-waterfall-jungle-green-tropical-vegetation-palm>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.wallpapers13.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Wonderful-tropical-waterfall-jungle-green-tropical-vegetation-palm-trees-rocky-shore-rocks-moss-green-pool-with-water-Desktop-Wallpaper-HD-1920x1200-1024x768.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.t2_5wfnPxcn4tmzNjTRqbwHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Wonderful Tropical Waterfall Jungle Green Tropical Vegetation Palm"><p><em>Source: wallpapers13.com</em></p><blockquote><p>waterfall tropical jungle desktop palm water trees pool rocky wonderful moss vegetation shore rocks wallpapers wallpapers13 1200.</p></blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a fun and unique way to add personality to your home, why not try piece wallpaper?
