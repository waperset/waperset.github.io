As the weather outside gets colder, many people are looking for ways to make their homes cozier. One way to do this is by removing old, outdated wallpaper and replacing it with something new.
Wallpaper removal can be a challenge, but it&rsquo;s worth it for the fresh new look it gives your home. Here are a few tips to help you get started:</p><ol><li><p>Start by scoring the wallpaper with a utility knife. This will help the stripper solution penetrate the paper and loosen the adhesive.</p></li><li><p>Apply a generous amount of stripper solution to the scored wallpaper and let it sit for about 15 minutes.</p></li><li><p>Use a putty knife or scraper to remove the loosened wallpaper. Start at the bottom and work your way up, being careful not to damage the wall underneath.</p></li><li></li></ol><h2 id=violet--bee-and-puppycat-cartoon-anime>Violet | Bee And Puppycat, Cartoon, Anime<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#violet--bee-and-puppycat-cartoon-anime>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f2/19/93/f21993cd158306e5ca5c7fd08526a7c1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.4PEQnHqZclE1cDqu1dI1mQHaG9&pid=15.1"' alt="Violet | Bee and puppycat, Cartoon, Anime"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>puppycat.</p></blockquote><ol start=2><li>Types of basketball wallpaper
