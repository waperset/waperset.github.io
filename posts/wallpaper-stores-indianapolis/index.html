Here are some tips from experts.</p><ol><li><p>Choose the right type of gold wallpaper. There are a variety of gold wallpapers on the market, so it&rsquo;s important to choose one that will work best in your space. If you&rsquo;re not sure which type of gold wallpaper to choose, consult with a professional designer or home improvement store employee.</p></li><li><p>Make sure the surface is smooth before you begin. Any bumps or imperfections in the surface will be magnified once the gold wallpaper is applied, so it&rsquo;s important to make sure the wall is as smooth as possible. Use sandpaper or a primer to even out the surface before you begin applying the wallpaper.</p></li><li><p>Hang the gold wallpaper using a professional adhesive. This will ensure that the wallpaper stays in place and doesn&rsquo;t peel away from the wall over time. Be sure to follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions when applying the adhesive to avoid any problems.</p></li></ol><h2 id=architecture-art-bridges-buildings-cities-city-indiana-5>Architecture, Art, Bridges, Buildings, Cities, City, Indiana<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#architecture-art-bridges-buildings-cities-city-indiana-5>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://wallup.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/484995-architecture-art-bridges-buildings-cities-city-indiana-indianapolis-downtown-graphitis-night-offices-port-center-storehouses-stores-towers-usa.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bq8R1g79ZU3w0ucovzSS_AHaFv&pid=15.1"' alt="architecture, Art, Bridges, Buildings, Cities, City, Indiana"><p><em>Source: wallup.net</em></p><blockquote><p>graphitis storehouses.</p></blockquote><p>Wallpaper trends
