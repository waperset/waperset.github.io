Some things to consider when choosing a wallpaper are its color palette, style and material. Some materials like vinyl can be easy to care for but may not last as long as other materials. Once you have decided on the style, color and material of your chosen wallpaper, it is time to find a retailer who carries the specific type of wallpaper you are looking for.</p><p>There are many stores that carry both traditional and modern wallpapers so finding the right one for your home is easy. When choosing a new piece of furniture or painting, take some time to go through all of your options and find what will fit best into your home décor.</p><h2 id=pompeian-mosaic-colossal-art-print--the-detroit-wallpaper-co>Pompeian Mosaic Colossal Art Print – The Detroit Wallpaper Co.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pompeian-mosaic-colossal-art-print--the-detroit-wallpaper-co>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0071/2176/4403/products/PompeianMosaic_RoomShot_48x72_300cffa6-912c-4782-8ad0-e20ef1c50671.jpg?v=1603482285" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.1OKxp4r0lsFKEYxTVvzBTgHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="Pompeian Mosaic Colossal Art Print – The Detroit Wallpaper Co."><p><em>Source: detroitwallpaper.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What is a grey wallpaper and why do people like it?
